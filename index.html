      <h3>🎶Classical Guitar🎶</h3>
      <p class="guitar-desc">Playing the guitar is one of the few things I can never get sick of, learning to play a piece yourself is some of the most gratifying experiences I've had. Some may say I'm an old soul but I can't get enough of old classics like Fly Me to the Moon and Autumn Leaves.</p>

      <h3>DyS2 of 35SCE</h3>
      <p class="dyS2-desc">Going through OCS was challenging and applying what I learnt as a DyS2 made it unforgettable. Taking charge of the security of a whole camp was no easy feat. It was only by learning how to cultivate teamwork and professionalism that our camp was able to be free of security issues during my period of service.</p>
